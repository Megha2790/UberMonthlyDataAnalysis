# Uber Data Analysis Project
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber ride data to uncover trends, insights, and potential areas for operational improvement. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation of Uber pickup patterns.

## 🔍 Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze Uber ride data to:

- Understand peak ride hours and days.

- Identify high-demand locations.

- Visualize trends based on time and geography.

- Provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

## 🧪 Key Analysis
1. Temporal Analysis
- Extracted date and time components.

- Identified peak hours, days, and months for rides.

2. Spatial Analysis
- Plotted heatmaps of pickup locations.

- Clustered hotspots based on ride frequency.

3. Distribution Analysis
- Frequency of pickups across different days of the week.

- Comparison of Uber activity across months.

## 📈 Key Insights
- Peak Hours: Highest demand observed during morning and evening rush hours.

- Busy Days: Weekends show increased ride activity.

- Hotspots: Central business districts and airports show dense pickup activity.

- Monthly Trends: Gradual increase in ride frequency over time.

## ✅ Conclusion
The EDA successfully reveals patterns in Uber usage that can guide business decisions like fleet allocation and surge pricing strategies. The findings can be extended with more granular data or machine learning models for forecasting.

## 🚀 Future Work
- Incorporate weather and event data for enhanced analysis.

- Apply clustering algorithms for more precise location grouping.

- Build predictive models for demand forecasting.# UberMonthlyDataAnalysis
